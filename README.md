# BookStoreApp-Distributed-Application

## About this project
This is an Ecommerce project where users can adds books to the cart and buy those books.

## Architecture
All the Microservices are developed using spring boot. 
This spring boot applications will be registered with eureka discovery server.

FrontEnd React App makes request's to NGINX server which acts as a reverse proxy.
NGINX server redirects the requests to Zuul API Gateway. 

Zuul will route the requests to microservice
based on the url route. Zuul also registers with eureka and gets the ip/domain from eureka for microservice while routing the request. 

## Run front-end app

Navigate to `bookstore-frontend-react-app` folder
Run below commnads to start Frontend React Application

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Build all microservice Jars
Run `mvn clean install` at root of project to build all the microservices jars.


## Run this project using Docker Swarm

Follow the [tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/create-swarm/) for setting up Docker Swarm on your cluster.

### Demo deployment
Run `deploy.sh` to automatically deploy the stack.

You can specify the compose file to be used and the name of the stack as follows:
`deploy.sh -n <name_of_stack> -c <compose_file>`

### Manual deployment

Create network: `docker network create --driver overlay bookstore-app-network`

Run `docker service create --name registry --publish published=5000,target=5000 registry:2` to create a disposable registry for the docker images.

Run `docker compose build` to build all the images.

Run `docker compose push` to push all the generated images to the local repository.

Run `docker stack deploy --with-registry-auth -c docker-compose.yml <name_of_stack>` to deploy the stack.

In order for telegraf to be able to read information from influxDB, you need to modify the docker GID accordingly in the `docker-compose.yml` file under the `bookstore-telegraf` configuration (specifically, `user: telegraf:<GID>`).

## Remove the stack from your swarm cluster

Bring stack down: `docker stack rm <name_of_stack>`

Remove local repository: `docker service rm registry`

### Service Discovery
This project uses Eureka or Consul as Discovery service.

While running services in local, then using eureka as service discovery.

While running using docker, consul is the service discovery. 

Reason to use Consul is it has better features and support compared to Eureka. Running services individually in local uses Eureka as service discovery because dont want to run consul agent and set it up as it becomes extra overhead to manage. Since docker-compose manages all consul stuff hence using Consul while running services in docker.

## TICK stack monitoring.

TICK(Telegraf, InfluxDB, Chronograf, Kapacitor) This setup is getting more attention due to its push and pull model. InfluxDB is a time series database, bookstore services push the metrics to influxDB(push model), In Telegraf we specify the targets to pull metrics(pull model). Chronograf/Graphana can be used to view the graph/charts. Kapacitor is used to configure rules for alarms.

Deploying with `docker-compose.yml` will take care of bringing all this monitoring containers up.

## Port Configurations

### Business Logic
| Service    | Port |
| --------   | -----|

| Billing    | 5001 |
| Catalog    | 6001 |
| Order      | 7001 |
| Payment    | 8001 |

### Administrative
| Service    | Port |
| --------   | -----|
| MySQL      | 3306 |
| Consul     | 8500 |
| Zuul       | 8765 |
| Telegraf   | 8125 |
| Zipkin     | 9411 |
| InfluxDB   | 8086 |
| Chronograf | 8888 |
| Kapacitor  | 9092 |



> Account Service

To Get `access_token` for the user, you need `clientId` and `clientSecret`

```
clientId : '93ed453e-b7ac-4192-a6d4-c45fae0d99ac'
clientSecret : 'client.devd123'
```

There are 2 users in the system currently. 
ADMIN, NORMAL USER

```
Admin 
userName: 'admin.admin'
password: 'admin.devd123'

```

## Issue

The issue was that microservices in nodes gl2 and gl6 couldn't communicate with services in gl5 in the Docker Swarm cluster because gl5 was blocking TCP connections on port 7946. This port is critical for Docker Swarm's internal communication. The problem was resolved by explicitly allowing traffic on port 7946 (TCP) and port 4789 (UDP) on gl5 using iptables commands, restoring proper communication between all nodes in the swarm : 
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 7946 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p udp -m udp --dport 4789 -j ACCEPT


```
Normal User 
userName: 'devd.cores'
password: 'cores.devd123'
```

*To get the accessToken (Admin User)* 

```curl 93ed453e-b7ac-4192-a6d4-c45fae0d99ac:client.devd123@localhost:4001/oauth/token -d grant_type=password -d username=admin.admin -d password=admin.devd123```
